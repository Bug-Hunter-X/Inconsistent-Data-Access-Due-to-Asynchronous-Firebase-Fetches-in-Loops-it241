# Firebase Asynchronous Data Fetching Issue

This repository demonstrates a common error encountered when working with Firebase's asynchronous data fetching methods within loops.  The problem arises because the loop iterates before the asynchronous callbacks complete, leading to inconsistent data access and potential errors.

## Problem Description

The provided code attempts to fetch data from Firebase for multiple IDs using a loop. However, the asynchronous nature of Firebase's `once()` method means the data might not be available when the loop accesses it.  This often results in `undefined` or `null` errors.

## Solution

The solution involves managing asynchronous operations properly.  Using `Promise.all()` ensures all fetches complete before processing the data, preventing race conditions and inconsistent data access.

## Setup and Usage

1.  Clone the repository.
2.  Install Firebase:
    ```bash
    npm install firebase
    ```
3.  Configure your Firebase project and credentials (replace placeholders in `bug.js` and `bugSolution.js`).
4.  Run `bug.js` to observe the error, and `bugSolution.js` to see the corrected implementation.
