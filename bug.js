The issue stems from an uncommon Firebase interaction where data is fetched asynchronously within a loop.  The loop iterates faster than the asynchronous callbacks return, leading to inconsistent data updates and potential crashes.  Specifically, the loop attempts to access properties of fetched data before the data has been fully populated, resulting in `undefined` or `null` errors.  This is exacerbated by the fact that Firebase's asynchronous nature isn't always immediately apparent to developers.

```javascript
for (let i = 0; i < someIds.length; i++) {
  const id = someIds[i];
  firebase.database().ref(`items/${id}`).once('value', (snapshot) => {
    const item = snapshot.val();
    console.log(item.name); // Error: item might be undefined here
    // ... more operations using item ...
  });
}
```
